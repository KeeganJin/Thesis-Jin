Afterwards, one of the following branches is executed:  1. a silent trasition leads to the completion of the process. 2. The order details are checked or the order automatically is approved. Once one of the alternative branches was executed the order payment is processed. Subsequently, the process is split into 2 parallel branches: - generate invoice and pick items from the warehouse. Once all 2 branches were executed, the items is packed. After that, quality check is conducted, which loops if needed. Then ship order to cusotmer, and the process is finished.","First, the process starts with Customer places order. Then, after the order is placed, an exclusive decision is made at the order stage: either a silent step (unnamed) is executed that leads directly toward completion, or Check order details is performed, or Approve order automatically is performed. Next, if either Check order details or Approve order automatically is chosen, the process continues with Process order payment. Then, Process order payment produces two branches simultaneously: one branch goes to Pick items from warehouse and the other goes to Generate Invoice. Next, from the Pick items from warehouse branch, the process moves on to Item check. Simultaneously, from the Generate Invoice branch, the process proceeds directly to Pack items. Then, after Item check, there is an exclusive choice: either Select unpicked items is performed, which loops the process back to Pick items from warehouse, or Pack items is executed. Finally, once Pack items is executed, the process concludes with Order shipped to customer."
