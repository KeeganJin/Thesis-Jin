pattern_APN_1,"This pattern process begins with the activity {a}, then depending on the condition either actiivty {b} and {c} are parallel executed or activity {d} is executed. Afterwards, acitivty {e} is executed and end the pattern process."
pattern_APN_2,"This pattern process starts with activity {a}. Following this, activities {b} and {c} are executed in parallel. Subsequently, either activity {d} is executed, forming a loop back to activities {b} and {c}, or activity {e} is executed, which concludes the pattern process."
pattern_basic_and_1,"This pattern process begins with the activity {a}, then activities {b} and {c} will be executed in parallel, afterwards activity {d} will be executed."
pattern_basic_and_2,"In this pattern process, actvity {a} and activity {b} are conducted in parallel."
pattern_basic_and_3,"The pattern process begins, when an {a} is conducted. Afterwards, the process is split into 3 parallel branches:  -Activity {c} is conducted.  -Activity {b} is conducted.  -Acvivity {d} is conducted. Once all 3 branches were executed, activity {e} is conducted. Subsequently, this pattern process is completed."
pattern_basic_and_4,"The pattern process begins, when an {a} is conducted. Afterwards, the process is split into 3 parallel branches:  -Activity {c} is conducted.  -Activity {b} is conducted.  -Acvivity {d} is conducted. -Acvivity {e} is conducted. Once all 4 branches were executed, activity {f} is conducted. Subsequently, this pattern process is completed."
pattern_basic_loop_1,"This pattern begins, when activity {a} is conducted.  Afterwards, the activity {b} is conducted.  -Subsequently, depending on the conditions, the process either loops between acitvity {c} and acitivty {b} or exits the loop and conduct acitivty {d}. The loop continues until the exit condition is satisfied, leading to process completion."
pattern_basic_loop_2,"This pattern process begins with the activity {a}, transitioning to an intermediate state. Within this state, the activity {b} forms a loop, repeating until the exit condition is met. Once the loop concludes, the activity {c} executes, marking the end of the pattern process."
pattern_basic_loop_3,"The pattern process begins, when activity {a} is conducted.  -Afterwards, {b} is conducted.  -Subsequently, {c} is conducted.  If it is required, the latter steps {b} and {c} are repeated. Once the loop is finished, the pattern process is completed."
pattern_basic_loop_4,"The pattern process begins, when activity {a} is conducted.  -Afterwards, {b} is conducted. If it is required, the acvitiy {b} is is repeated after {c}, and form a loop. Once the loop is finished, the pattern process is completed."
pattern_basic_loop_5,"The pattern process begins, when activity {a} is conducted.  -Afterwards, {b} is conducted. If it is required, the acvitiy {b} is is repeated after {c}, and form a loop. Once the loop is finished, activity {d} is conducted, then the pattern process is completed."
pattern_basic_xor_1,"In this pattern process, one of the following acitivites is executed:  The activity {a} is executed, or acitivity {b} is executed."
pattern_basic_xor_2,"The pattern process begins, when an activity {a} is conducted. Afterwards, one of the following branches is executed:  -The {b} is conducted.  -The {c} is conducted."
pattern_basic_xor_3,"In this pattern process, one of the following acitivites is executed:  - The activity {a} is executed, or - acitivity {b} is executed or -acitivity {c} is executed ."
pattern_BPIC_1,"In this pattern process, one of the following branches is executed.  -The {a} is conducted.  -Or the branch is split into 2 parallel branches, the {c} and the {b} is conducted in parallel, once the 2 activities were executed, the {d} is conducted. "
pattern_BPIC_2,"In this pattern process, one of the following branches is executed.  1. The {a} is conducted.  2. Or, {b} s conducted, then {c} is conducted."
pattern_BPIC_3,"In this pattern process, {a} and {b} are conducted in parallel, afterwards {c} is conducted."
pattern_free_choice_petri_net_1,"This pattern process starts with a choice, either acitivity {a} or activity {b} is conducted, then, acitivity {c} and acitivity {d} are conducted, then, activity {e} and {f} are conducted and end the pattern process."
pattern_PETRINET_1_1,"This pattern process begins, when activity {a} is conducted.  Afterwards, it follows with a xor gate, one of the acitivites {b} and {c} is executed. After that, if it is required, it loops back the acvitiy {a} by conducting {d}. Once the loop is finished, the pattern process is completed."
pattern_PETRINET_1_2,"This pattern process begins, when {e} is conducted.  Afterwards, {a} is conducted and the process is split into 2 parallel branches, {b} and {c} are conducted in parallel, once 2 branches were executed,  {d} is conducted, thereafter, {f} is conducted. If it is required, it loops back to {a}, and the latter steps are repeated and the process continues with conducting {a}. Once the loop is finished, the process is completed."
pattern_PETRINET_1_3,"In this pattern process, one of the following branches is executed: - {d} is conducted.  -Or,  {a} is conducted, after that, {b} or {c} is conducted. "
pattern_edge_1,"The pattern process starts with {a}; immediately afterwards an exclusive choice sends the flow either to {c} (first branch) or to {b} (second branch). If {c} is taken, a second exclusive choice occurs: one option is {e} followed by {g}, the other is {x} followed by {f}. If {b} is taken, it leads directly to {d}, which then continues to {f}. Regardless of how the flow arrives—via {g} or {f} —they converge after the  exclusive choice,  then the single activity {h} is executed, and the process ends."
pattern_edge_2,"This pattern process starts with an exclusive choice between {a} and {b}; afterwards {c} always executes; finally, the path taken earlier decides the last step—if this pattern began with {a} the flow ends with {d}, otherwise it ends with {e}."
pattern_edge_3,"This pattern process starts with Activity {a}; on completion it forks into two concurrent paths: the first branch executes {b} → {d} → {f}, with {d} also sending a synchronisation token toward {e}, while the second branch executes {c}. Activity {e} waits for the token from {c} (second branch) and the token emitted by {d} (first branch); once both are present it fires, followed by {g}. The results of {f} (first branch) and {g} (after the join) converge in {h}; when both tokens arrive, {h} executes and the process ends."
pattern_a1,"The pattern process begins with an exclusive choice: either an AND-split fires, launching the two parallel activities {a} and {b}, or the single activity {c} is executed instead; if the parallel route is taken, both {a} and {b} must complete before the flow reaches the end, whereas in the sequential route {c} is immediately followed by {d}; regardless of whether the process arrives from the join after {a}+{b} or from {d}, this pattern process then terminates."
pattern_a2,"The pattern process starts with an exclusive choice among three alternatives—{a}, {b}, or {f}; if {f} is selected it passes through {g} and then ends; if {a} is selected, then {c} is executed, and then {d} is executted and then ends; if {b} is executed, then {c} is executed and then {e} is executed and then ends."
